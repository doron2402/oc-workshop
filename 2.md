# Refactor your component

* Move the css to a separate static CSS file.
* Create a `<script>` code that would asynchronously load the static CSS using the [`oc.require`](https://github.com/opentable/oc/blob/master/docs/browser-client.md#ocrequire-namespace-url-callback) functionality, and use javascript to hide the markup until the CSS is loaded. 
* Well done! [Part III](3.md)
